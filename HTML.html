Narrative:
1. The program then opens an <html> tag, indicating the start of an HTML document.
2. Inside the <html> element, the program opens a <head> tag, signaling the beginning of the head section where meta information and document title are typically placed.
3. The program includes a <title> tag inside the head section. The title element specifies the title of the document, which is used by the browser's title bar or tab.
4. Between the opening and closing <title> tags, the program places the text "Hello, World!" which is what will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab for this page.
5. Following the head section, the program closes the <head> tag and begins the body section with an opening <body> tag. The body element contains the content of the HTML document that will be visible to the user.
6. Inside the body, the program uses a paragraph element, <p>, to define a block of text.
7. Between the opening and closing <p> tags, the text "Hello, world!" is placed, which will be displayed as a paragraph on the webpage.
8. The program then closes the <body> element to signify the end of the visible content of the page.
9. Lastly, the program ends with a closing </html> tag, which marks the end of the HTML document.
