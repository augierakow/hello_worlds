; Clojure "Hello, World!" program
(println "Hello, World!")


(Narrative:

1. The program starts with a semicolon ;, which Clojure uses to denote a single-line comment. Anything following the semicolon on that line is ignored by the Clojure interpreter, which allows developers to include annotations or disable code.
2. The program calls the println function, which is built into Clojure's standard library. In Clojure, functions are called by enclosing them in parentheses ( ), following the Lisp tradition.
3. The println function is passed a single string argument "Hello, World!". This string is delimited by double quotes "", indicating that it is a text value.
4. When the println function is executed, it prints the string "Hello, World!" to the standard output, typically the console or terminal. In addition to the string, it also prints a newline character, so any subsequent output will begin on the next line.
5. Since Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, the programâ€™s syntax follows the form of S-expressions, where the function call (println "Hello, World!") is an expression that is self-contained and executable on its own.
6. The program contains no further instructions; therefore, after printing the message, it concludes its execution.
7. Clojure's simplicity in syntax and functional programming nature make it concise and powerful for various applications, especially in the domains of data processing and concurrent programming.)
