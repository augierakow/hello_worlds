; Lisp  Lis


(print "Hello, world!")

#|
1. The program invokes a function using the opening parenthesis `(`, characteristic of Lisp's prefix notation.
2. The program references the built-in `print` function. In Lisp, `print` is a standard function used for outputting values to the console.
3. The `print` function is called with a single argument, the string `"Hello, world!"`. There are no special characters, so it will print to the console exactly as it appears between the quotes.
4. The program reads the closing parenthesis `)`, signaling the end of the function call, and moves to the next operation or concludes if there are no further instructions, which is the case here.
Notes:
Lisp code often appears with many nested parentheses, due to its s-expression-based syntax, but in this simple example, there's only one function call, resulting in a single pair of parentheses.
