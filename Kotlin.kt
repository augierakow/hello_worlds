// Kotlin (for Andoid apps etc)

fun main() {
  println("Hello, world!")
}

/* 
Narrative:
1. The program defines a main function, which is the entry point of a Kotlin application.
2. Inside the main function, it calls println, a built-in function that prints a line of text to the console.
3. It provides "Hello, world!" as the argument to println, representing the text to be displayed.
4. On execution, this function will output the string to the console, followed by a new line.
