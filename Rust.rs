Narrative:
1. The program defines a function main which is the starting point of a Rust program.
2. It calls the macro println!, which prints text to the console and moves to a new line.
3. The string "Hello, world!" is provided as an argument to the macro.
4. Upon execution, the macro will print the string to the console, including a newline character at the end.
