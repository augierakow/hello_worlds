// Go (Golang)

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}

/* 
Narrative:
1. The program starts with the package keyword followed by the name main. In Go, every program is made up of packages, and the package main signifies the entry point of the program.
2. The program declares a function named main using the func keyword. The main function, in this case, serves as the starting point for execution of the program.
3. Inside the main function, the program then imports the fmt package using the import keyword. The fmt package in Go provides I/O functions to work with formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.
4. The program then calls the Println method from the fmt package with the string "Hello, world!" as its argument. This method prints the provided string to the console, followed by a newline.
5. The program concludes when the main function completes its execution.
