// Java

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}

/*
Narrative:
1. The program begins by declaring a new class named HelloWorld. In Java, every program consists of at least one class, and classes are the primary building blocks for organizing code.
2. The keyword public indicates that the HelloWorld class is accessible from other classes. (Visibility modifiers in Java determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. public means it is accessible from anywhere.)
3. Inside the HelloWorld class, the program declares a main method using the public static void main(String[] args) signature. This specific signature is significant because the main method serves as the entry point for Java programs.
4. The method is public, so it can be accessed from outside the class.
5. The keyword static indicates that the main method belongs to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. It can be called without creating an instance of the class.
6. The method returns void, meaning it does not return a value.
7. The method accepts a single parameter: an array of String objects named args. This array contains any command-line arguments passed to the program when it's executed.
8. Inside the main method, the program references the built-in System class. In Java, System is a standard class that provides access to system-related resources, such as input and output streams.
9. The program accesses the out field of the System class, which represents the standard output stream (typically, the console).
10. The program then invokes the println method on the out stream with a single argument, the string "Hello, world!". This method prints the string to the console followed by a newline.
11. Finally, the program ends with the closing braces } that delineate the end of the main method and the HelloWorld class, respectively.
