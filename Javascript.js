// Javascript

console.log('Hello, world!');

/*   Narrative:

1. The code references the global `console` object. 
(In JavaScript, `console` is a built-in object that 
rovides access to the browser's debugging console.

2. The `.` (dot) operator accesses the `log` method 
on the `console` object. (The dot operator is a fundamental 
aspect of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, allowing 
access to an object's properties and methods.)

3. The `log` method is then invoked with a single argument, 
the string `'Hello, world!'`. (Single quotes are a standard 
way to define string values in JavaScript.)

4. When this line of code is executed, the `log` method outputs 
the message `Hello, world!` to the console.

5. The code ends a semicolon. (Semicolons are optional in 
JavaScript, but they are typically used to indicate the end 
of a statement for readability and to prevent unexpected 
behavior in certain situations.)
