# Python

print("Hello, world!")

"""
Narrative:
1. The program references the built-in `print` function. In Python, `print` is a standard function used for outputting values to the console.
2. The `print` function is invoked with a single argument, the string `"Hello, world!"`. (Double quotes are one way to define string values in Python; single quotes can also be used.)
3. Inside the string `"Hello, world!"`, there are no special characters, so it will print exactly as it appears between the quotes.
4. When this line of code is executed, the `print` function outputs the message `Hello, world!` to the console.
5. Unlike some other languages, Python doesn't require a semicolon to end a statement; statements end at the end of the line, or when there's a new line character.
6. The code is concise, making use of Python's simple syntax to achieve the desired output in a single line.
